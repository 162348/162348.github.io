abstract ={bandit問題ではポリシーが経時変化するadaptiveな手法であるため，従来の独立性に依拠した極限定理に基づいた手法は適用出来ない．その上，重点的に選択されなかったarmについては極めてサンプル数が少なくなることが多いため，正規近似の手法も適用できない．これに対して，元々はジャンプを持つ拡散過程の汎関数の分布の漸近展開を計算するために用いられたパーシャルミキシング過程についての後ろ向き漸近展開とその正当性を導入して解決した．さらに，ランダム関数のbackward propagation (?)に対応するための手法の拡張も論じる．また，数値実験による手法の有効性も確認した．この手法は，一般のadaptiveにデザインされた，非線型なパラメータを持つ可微分な模型に応用可能である．}

The yield corresponding to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula for the variance of the difference between the averages of the observed yields of two varieties. This variance involves the variance over all plots of the potential yields and the correlation coefficient $r$ between the potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot. Since it is impossible to estimate $r$ directly, Neyman advises taking $r = 1$, observing that in practice this may lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation, when comparing two variety means.},

    abstract = {The task of estimating causal effects from non-experimental data is notoriously difficult and unreliable. Nevertheless, precisely such estimates are commonly required in many fields including economics and social science, where controlled experiments are often impossible. Linear causal models (structural equation models), combined with an implicit normality (Gaussianity) assumption on the data, provide a widely used framework for this task. We have recently described how non-Gaussianity in the data can be exploited for estimating causal effects. In this paper we show that, with non-Gaussian data, causal inference is possible even in the presence of hidden variables (unobserved confounders), even when the existence of such variables is unknown a priori. Thus, we provide a comprehensive and complete framework for the estimation of causal effects between the observed variables in the linear, non-Gaussian domain. Numerical simulations demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed method, with full Matlab code available for all simulations.}
