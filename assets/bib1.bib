	abstract = {A sequence of random variables is called exchangeable if the joint distribution of the sequence is unchanged by any permutation of the indices. De Finetti's theorem characterizes all {0,1}-valued exchangeable sequences as a `mixture' of sequences of independent random variables. We present a new, elementary proof of de Finetti's Theorem. The purpose of this paper is to make this theorem accessible to a broader community through an essentially self-contained proof.},

	abstract = {Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. An increase in the severity of albuminuria and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, by which the DKD stages are categorized, are associated with higher risks of not only end-stage renal disease but also all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Thus, an optimal management strategy and adequate assessment of therapeutic success are of great clinical and societal relevance to improve the prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKD. At present, comprehensive risk management for glycemia, blood pressure, lipid profile, and lifestyle habits is emphasized with respect to cardio-renal protection, rather than one single risk management approach. However, the pharmacological therapy aiming at strict control of these risk factors may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects, particularly in older adults with diabetes. Accordingly, in the clinical practice of diabetes care, we need to individualize the treatment goals for each risk factor according to the health and social status of each patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKD.},

  abstract = 	 {Copulas allow to learn marginal distributions separately from the multivariate dependence structure (copula) that links them together into a density function.  Vine factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference, it is common to assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent from its conditioning variables.  In this paper, we relax this assumption by discovering the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning variables.  We learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for scalable, approximate inference. Experiments on real-world datasets show that, when modeling all conditional dependencies, we obtain better estimates of the underlying copula of the data.}

    abstract = { Reversible jump methods are the most commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo tool for exploring variable dimension statistical models. Recently, however, an alternative approach based on birth-and-death processes has been proposed by Stephens for mixtures of distributions. We show that the birth-and-death setting can be generalized to include other types of continuous time jumps like split-and-combine moves in the spirit of Richardson and Green. We illustrate these extensions both for mixtures of distributions and for hidden Markov models. We demonstrate the strong similarity of reversible jump and continuous time methodologies by showing that, on appropriate rescaling of time, the reversible jump chain converges to a limiting continuous time birth-and-death process. A numerical comparison in the setting of mixtures of distributions highlights this similarity.},

An adaptive Monte Carlo integration technique known as the Gibbs sampler is proposed as a mechanism for implementing a conceptually and computationally simple solution in such a framework. The result is a general strategy for obtaining marginal posterior densities under changing specification of the model error densities and related prior densities. We illustrate the approach in a nonlinear regression setting, comparing the merits of three candidate error distributions. /// Une approche bayesienne est présentée afin d'aborder une classe étendue de problèmes du type non conjugué.

However, comparison across models may not proceed in a completely analogous fashion, owing to violations of the conditions sufficient to ensure convergence of the Markov chain. In this paper we present a framework for Bayesian model choice, along with an MCMC algorithm that does not suffer from convergence difficulties. Our algorithm applies equally well to problems where only one model is contemplated but its proper size is not known at the outset, such as problems involving integer-valued parameters, multiple changepoints or finite mixture distributions. We illustrate our approach with two published examples.},
