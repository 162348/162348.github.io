De Finetti's theorem characterizes all {0,1}-valued exchangeable sequences as a `mixture' of sequences of independent random variables. We present a new, elementary proof of de Finetti's Theorem. The purpose of this paper is to make this theorem accessible to a broader community through an essentially self-contained proof.},

	abstract = {Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. An increase in the severity of albuminuria and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, by which the DKD stages are categorized, are associated with higher risks of not only end-stage renal disease but also all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Thus, an optimal management strategy and adequate assessment of therapeutic success are of great clinical and societal relevance to improve the prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKD. At present, comprehensive risk management for glycemia, blood pressure, lipid profile, and lifestyle habits is emphasized with respect to cardio-renal protection, rather than one single risk management approach. However, the pharmacological therapy aiming at strict control of these risk factors may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects, particularly in older adults with diabetes. Accordingly, in the clinical practice of diabetes care, we need to individualize the treatment goals for each risk factor according to the health and social status of each patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKD.},

Vine factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference, it is common to assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent from its conditioning variables.  In this paper, we relax this assumption by discovering the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning variables.  We learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for scalable, approximate inference. Experiments on real-world datasets show that, when modeling all conditional dependencies, we obtain better estimates of the underlying copula of the data.}

Recently, however, an alternative approach based on birth-and-death processes has been proposed by Stephens for mixtures of distributions. We show that the birth-and-death setting can be generalized to include other types of continuous time jumps like split-and-combine moves in the spirit of Richardson and Green. We illustrate these extensions both for mixtures of distributions and for hidden Markov models. We demonstrate the strong similarity of reversible jump and continuous time methodologies by showing that, on appropriate rescaling of time, the reversible jump chain converges to a limiting continuous time birth-and-death process. A numerical comparison in the setting of mixtures of distributions highlights this similarity.},

These include the nonconjugate SSVS formulation of George and McCulloch (1993), as well as conjugate formulations which allow for analytical simplification. Hyperparameter settings which base selection on practical significance, and the implications of using mixtures with point priors are discussed. Computational methods for posterior evaluation and exploration are considered. Rapid updating methods are seen to provide feasible methods for exhaustive evaluation using Gray Code sequencing in moderately sized problems, and fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration in large problems. Estimation of normalization constants is seen to provide improved posterior estimates of individual model probabilities and the total visited probability. Various procedures are illustrated on simulated sample problems and on a real problem concerning the construction of financial index tracking portfolios.},

abstract = {Choosing a statistical model and accounting for uncertainty about this choice are important parts of the scientific process and are required for common statistical tasks such as parameter estimation, interval estimation, statistical inference, point prediction, and interval prediction. A canonical example is the choice of variables in a linear regression model. Many ways of doing this have been proposed, including Bayesian and penalized regression methods, and it is not clear which are best. We compare 21 popular methods via an extensive simulation study based on a wide range of real datasets. We found that three adaptive Bayesian model averaging methods performed best across all the statistical tasks and that two of these were also among the most computationally efficient. Probability models are used for many statistical tasks, notably parameter estimation, interval estimation, inference about model parameters, point prediction, and interval prediction. Thus, choosing a statistical model and accounting for uncertainty about this choice are important parts of the scientific process. Here we focus on one such choice, that of variables to include in a linear regression model. Many methods have been proposed, including Bayesian and penalized likelihood methods, and it is unclear which one to use. We compared 21 of the most popular methods by carrying out an extensive set of simulation studies based closely on real datasets that span a range of situations encountered in practical data analysis. Three adaptive Bayesian model averaging (BMA) methods performed best across all statistical tasks. These used adaptive versions of Zellner’s g-prior for the parameters, where the prior variance parameter g is a function of sample size or is estimated from the data. We found that for BMA methods implemented with Markov chain Monte Carlo, 10,000 iterations were enough. Computationally, we found two of the three best methods (BMA with g=n and empirical Bayes-local) to be competitive with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which is often preferred as a variable selection technique because of its computational efficiency. BMA performed better than Bayesian model selection (in which just one model is selected).}}

First, we study the standard “global‐local shrinkage” approach, based on scale mixtures of normals. Two theorems are presented which characterize certain desirable properties of shrinkage priors for sparse problems. Next, we review some recent results showing how Lévy processes can be used to generate infinite‐dimensional versions of standard normal scale‐mixture priors, along with new priors that have yet to be seriously studied in the literature. This approach provides an intuitive framework both for generating new regularization penalties and shrinkage rules, and for performing asymptotic analysis on existing models.},

This paper introduces new aspects of the broader Bayesian treatment of lasso regression. A direct characterization of the regression coefficients' posterior distribution is provided, and computation and inference under this characterization is shown to be straightforward. Emphasis is placed on point estimation using the posterior mean, which facilitates prediction of future observations via the posterior predictive distribution. It is shown that the standard lasso prediction method does not necessarily agree with model-based, Bayesian predictions. A new Gibbs sampler for Bayesian lasso regression is introduced.},

The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Abstract Multicomponent analysis attempts to simultaneously predict the ingredients of a mixture. If near-infrared spectroscopy provides the predictor variables, then modern scanning instruments may offer absorbances at a very large number of wavelengths. Although it is perfectly possible to use whole spectrum methods (e.g. PLS, ridge and principal component regression), for a number of reasons it is often desirable to select a small number of wavelengths from which to construct the prediction equation relating absorbances to composition. This paper considers wavelength selection with a view to using the chosen wavelengths to simultaneously predict the compositional ingredients and is therefore an example of multivariate variable selection. It adopts a binary exclusion/inclusion latent variable formulation of selection and uses a Bayesian approach. Problems of search of the vast number of possible selected models are overcome by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler using an informed proposal scheme, which we prove achieves a much faster mixing time that is independent of the number of covariates, under the assumptions of Yang et al. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-dimensional result which rigorously shows that the mixing rate of informed MCMC methods can be fast enough to offset the computational cost of local posterior evaluation. Motivated by the theoretical analysis of our sampler, we further propose a new approach called ‘two-stage drift condition’ to studying convergence rates of Markov chains on general state spaces, which can be useful for obtaining tight complexity bounds in high-dimensional settings. The practical advantages of our algorithm are illustrated by both simulation studies and real data analysis.},

Inherent advantages in terms of certain consistency requirements of a least square procedure for seasonal adjustment are pointed out. Problems encountered by the econometrician when seasonally adjusted time series are to be employed in regression analysis are also explored. The dummy variable technique for dealing with seasonal fluctuations is generalized to encompass a flexible pattern of seasonal movement. It is argued that when seasonally adjusted data rather than the dummy variable procedure are employed, there is an inherent tendency to overstate the significance of regression coefficients; a correction procedure is suggested. Consideration is given to certain special problems created by autocorrelated residuals when seasonally adjusted data are utilized in regression analysis.},

(Biometrika 108(1):53--69, 2021), can be viewed as particular cases within the framework. We then describe a novel algorithm, the adaptive random neighbourhood informed sampler, which combines ideas from these existing approaches. We show using several examples of both real and simulated data-sets that a computationally efficient point-wise implementation (PARNI) provides more reliable inferences on a range of variable selection problems, particularly in the very large p setting.},

abstract = {In contrast to a posterior analysis given a particular sampling model, posterior model probabilities in the context of model uncertainty are typically rather sensitive to the specification of the prior. In particular, ‘diffuse’ priors on model-specific parameters can lead to quite unexpected consequences. Here we focus on the practically relevant situation where we need to entertain a (large) number of sampling models and we have (or wish to use) little or no subjective prior information. We aim at providing an ‘automatic’ or ‘benchmark’ prior structure that can be used in such cases. We focus on the normal linear regression model with uncertainty in the choice of regressors. We propose a partly non-informative prior structure related to a natural conjugate g-prior specification, where the amount of subjective information requested from the user is limited to the choice of a single scalar hyperparameter g0j. The consequences of different choices for g0j are examined. We investigate theoretical properties, such as consistency of the implied Bayesian procedure. Links with classical information criteria are provided. More importantly, we examine the finite sample implications of several choices of g0j in a simulation study. The use of the MC3 algorithm of Madigan and York (Int. Stat. Rev. 63 (1995) 215), combined with efficient coding in Fortran, makes it feasible to conduct large simulations. In addition to posterior criteria, we shall also compare the predictive performance of different priors. A classic example concerning the economics of crime will also be provided and contrasted with results in the literature. The main findings of the paper will lead us to propose a ‘benchmark’ prior specification in a linear regression context with model uncertainty.}

Bayesian model averaging has become an important tool in empirical settings with large numbers of potential regressors and relatively limited numbers of observations.

We illustrate these issues in the context of cross-country growth regressions using three datasets with 41–67 potential drivers of growth and 72–93 observations.

abstract = {Linear models with a growing number of parameters have been widely used in modern statistics. One important problem about this kind of model is the variable selection issue. Bayesian approaches, which provide a stochastic search of informative variables, have gained popularity. In this paper, we will study the asymptotic properties related to Bayesian model selection when the model dimension p is growing with the sample size n. We consider p≤n and provide sufficient conditions under which: (1) with large probability, the posterior probability of the true model (from which samples are drawn) uniformly dominates the posterior probability of any incorrect models; and (2) the posterior probability of the true model converges to one in probability. Both (1) and (2) guarantee that the true model will be selected under a Bayesian framework. We also demonstrate several situations when (1) holds but (2) fails, which illustrates the difference between these two properties. Finally, we generalize our results to include g-priors, and provide simulation examples to illustrate the main results.}

The adaptive design of these algorithms exploits the observation that in large-\$p\$, small-\$n\$ settings, the majority of the \$p\$ variables will be approximately uncorrelated a posteriori. The algorithms adaptively build suitable nonlocal proposals that result in moves with squared jumping distance significantly larger than standard methods.

Most evidence comes from observational analyses showing that treatment-induced short-term changes in albuminuria correlate with risk change for ESRD. However, such studies are prone to selection bias and residual confounding. To minimize this bias, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to correlate the placebo-corrected drug effect on albuminuria and ESRD to more reliably delineate the association between changes in albuminuria and ESRD. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for clinical trials reported between 1950 and April 2014. Included trials had a mean follow-up of ≥1000 patient-years, reported ESRD outcomes, and measured albuminuria at baseline and during follow-up. Twenty-one clinical trials involving 78,342 patients and 4183 ESRD events were included. Median time to first albuminuria measurement was 6 months. Fourteen trials tested the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors and seven trials tested other interventions. We observed variability across trials in the treatment effect on albuminuria (range, −1.3{\%} to −32.1{\%}) and ESRD (range, −55{\%} to +35{\%} risk change). Meta-regression analysis revealed that the placebo-adjusted treatment effect on albuminuria significantly correlated with the treatment effect on ESRD: for each 30{\%} reduction in albuminuria, the risk of ESRD decreased by 23.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 11.4{\%} to 34.2{\%}; P=0.001). The association was consistent regardless of drug class (P=0.73) or other patient or trial characteristics. These findings suggest albuminuria may be a valid substitute for ESRD in many circumstances, even taking into account possible other drug-specific effects that may alter renal outcomes.},

We point out the difficulty is that the heat flow is exactly solvable, but neither its forward nor backward method is implementable in general, except for Gaussian data. We propose the symmetrized Langevin algorithm (SLA), which should have a smaller bias than ULA, at the price of implementing a proximal gradient step in space. We show SLA is in fact consistent for Gaussian target measure, whereas ULA is not. We also illustrate various algorithms explicitly for Gaussian target measure with Gaussian data, including gradient descent, proximal gradient, and Forward-Backward, and show they are all consistent.}

	abstract = { Discrete optimal transportation problems arise in various contexts in engineering, the sciences, and the social sciences. Often the underlying cost criterion is unknown, or only partly known, and the observed optimal solutions are corrupted by noise. In this paper we propose a systematic approach to infer unknown costs from noisy observations of optimal transportation plans. The algorithm requires only the ability to solve the forward optimal transport problem, which is a linear program, and to generate random numbers. It has a Bayesian interpretation and may also be viewed as a form of stochastic optimization. We illustrate the developed methodologies using the example of international migration flows. Reported migration flow data captures (noisily) the number of individuals moving from one country to another in a given period of time. It can be interpreted as a noisy observation of an optimal transportation map, with costs related to the geographical position of countries. We use a graph-based formulation of the problem, with countries at the nodes of graphs and nonzero weighted adjacencies only on edges between countries which share a border. We use the proposed algorithm to estimate the weights, which represent cost of transition, and to quantify uncertainty in these weights. },

    abstract = {We apply the irreversible event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm to the simulation of dense all-atom systems with long-range Coulomb interactions. ECMC is event-driven and exactly samples the Boltzmann distribution. It neither uses time-step approximations nor spatial cutoffs on the range of the interaction potentials. Most importantly, it need not evaluate the total Coulomb potential and thus circumvents the major computational bottleneck of traditional approaches. It only requires the derivatives of the two-particle Coulomb potential, for which we discuss mutually consistent choices. ECMC breaks up the total interaction potential into factors. For particle systems made up of neutral dipolar molecules, we demonstrate the superior performance of dipole–dipole factors that do not decompose the Coulomb potential beyond the two-molecule level. We demonstrate that these long-range factors can nevertheless lead to local lifting schemes, where subsequently moved particles are mostly close to each other. For the simple point-charge water model with flexible molecules (SPC/Fw), which combines the long-ranged intermolecular Coulomb potential with hydrogen–oxygen bond-length vibrations, a flexible hydrogen–oxygen–hydrogen bond angle, and Lennard-Jones oxygen–oxygen potentials, we break up the potential into factors containing between two and six particles. For this all-atom liquid-water model, we demonstrate that the computational complexity of ECMC scales very well with the system size. This is achieved in a pure particle–particle framework, without the interpolating mesh required for the efficient implementation of other modern Coulomb algorithms. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges for ECMC and outline several future applications.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Early diagnosis of individuals' at-risk mental state (ARMS) is important for preventing their pathogenesis or, at least, delaying onset of overt psychosis. Traditional diagnosis of ARMS subjects is mainly based on structured interviews, but future diagnosis would be carried out together with biomarkers. Aim In this study, we report urinary biopyrrins and free immunoglobin light chains κ and λ (κFLC and λFLC) as novel diagnostic biomarker candidates for screening ARMS subjects. Methods Nineteen ARMS subjects and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Inclusion criteria of the ARMS subjects were based on a comprehensive assessment of Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes. We compared oxidative stress and immunological markers in the urine of ARMS subjects with those of healthy controls by ELISA protocol. Results Augmentation of biopyrrins and reduction of κFLC and λFLC were found in the ARMS samples, and their diagnostic performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, of which area under the curve was as large as 0.915 in combination. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the ARMS subjects were under higher oxidative stress but lower in B cell activation, and that the combined assay of urinary biopyrrins and free immunoglobulin light chains would be useful for the early detection and screening of ARMS subjects among adolescents.},

Methods  Eighty-six brickfield workers and 90 administrative controls were assessed using the Arabic validated version of the Occupational Stress Index. The urinary levels of oxidative biomarkers; 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine and biopyrrins were also measured.  Results  The prevalence of moderate and severe OS in addition to the urinary levels of both oxidative biomarkers was significantly higher among the brickfield workers compared with their controls. Both biomarkers levels were significantly and positively correlated with scores of Occupational Stress Index, duration of employment, and with each other. The receiver operating characteristic analysis showed significant specificity and sensitivity of both biomarkers for determining the level of OS.  Conclusions  A significant association between occupational and oxidative stresses was detected in brickfield workers.},

This chapter focuses on bond percolation on the square lattice and briefly describes percolation model; this model is a special but perhaps the most interesting case of the general theory of percolation. It introduces the FKG inequality of Fortuin, Kasteleyn, and Ginibre; it proves a remarkable inequality showing that nondecreasing functions on a finite distributive lattice are positively correlated by all positive measures, which have a certain convexity property. The problem of percolation through an n × n sponge is introduced. The chapter also examines two of the possible critical probabilities pT and pH and uses the theory developed for the sponge problem to prove the result pT + pH = 1. By the percolation model on G, one mean the assignment of open or closed to each edge of G with probabilities p and q = 1 - p respectively, the assignments to be independent for each edge.}

    abstract = {Statisticians often face the choice between using probability models or a paradigm defined by minimising a loss function. Both approaches are useful and, if the loss can be re-cast into a proper probability model, there are many tools to decide which model or loss is more appropriate for the observed data, in the sense of explaining the data's nature. However, when the loss leads to an improper model, there are no principled ways to guide this choice. We address this task by combining the Hyvärinen score, which naturally targets infinitesimal relative probabilities, and general Bayesian updating, which provides a unifying framework for inference on losses and models. Specifically we propose the ℋ-score, a general Bayesian selection criterion and prove that it consistently selects the (possibly improper) model closest to the data-generating truth in Fisher's divergence. We also prove that an associated ℋ-posterior consistently learns optimal hyper-parameters featuring in loss functions, including a challenging tempering parameter in generalised Bayesian inference. As salient examples, we consider robust regression and non-parametric density estimation where popular loss functions define improper models for the data and hence cannot be dealt with using standard model selection tools. These examples illustrate advantages in robustness-efficiency trade-offs and enable Bayesian inference for kernel density estimation, opening a new avenue for Bayesian non-parametrics.},

	abstract = {Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods may be employed to search for a probability distribution over a bounded space of function arguments to estimate which argument(s) optimize(s) an objective function. This search-based optimization requires sampling the suitability, or fitness, of arguments in the search space. When the objective function or the fitness of arguments vary with time, significant exploration of the search space is required. Search efficiency then becomes a more relevant measure of the usefulness of an MCMC method than traditional measures such as convergence speed to the stationary distribution and asymptotic variance of stationary distribution estimates. Search efficiency refers to how quickly prior information about the search space is traded-off for search effort savings. Optimal search efficiency occurs when the entropy of the probability distribution over the space during search is maximized. Whereas the Metropolis case of the Hastings MCMC algorithm with fixed candidate generation is optimal with respect to asymptotic variance of stationary distribution estimates, this paper proves that Barker's case is optimal with respect to search efficiency if the fitness of the arguments in the search space is characterized by an exponential function. The latter instance of optimality is beneficial for time-varying optimization that is also model-independent.},

  abstract = 	 {Designing biological sequences is an important challenge that requires satisfying complex constraints and thus is a natural problem to address with deep generative modeling. Diffusion generative models have achieved considerable success in many applications. Score-based generative stochastic differential equations (SDE) model is a continuous-time diffusion model framework that enjoys many benefits, but the originally proposed SDEs are not naturally designed for modeling discrete data. To develop generative SDE models for discrete data such as biological sequences, here we introduce a diffusion process defined in the probability simplex space with stationary distribution being the Dirichlet distribution. This makes diffusion in continuous space natural for modeling discrete data. We refer to this approach as Dirchlet diffusion score model. We demonstrate that this technique can generate samples that satisfy hard constraints using a Sudoku generation task. This generative model can also solve Sudoku, including hard puzzles, without additional training. Finally, we applied this approach to develop the first human promoter DNA sequence design model and showed that designed sequences share similar properties with natural promoter sequences.}

@article{Dobrushin1956,
	abstract = { This paper is a continuation of investigations on the central limit theorem for nonstationary Markov chains, carried out by Markov (1910), Bernstein (1922--1936), Sapogov (1947--1949) and Linnik (1948--1949).Let \$\Omega \_i ,i = 1,2\$, be sets of states of the chain, and \$\mathfrak{A}\_i\$ be \$\sigma \$-algebras of measurable subsets of these sets. A function \${\bf P}(x,B)\, (x \in \Omega \_1 ,B \in \mathfrak{A}\_2 )\$ is called a stochastic transition function if it has the following properties: 1) if \${\bf P}(x,B)\$ for fixed B is a measurable function of x; 2) if \${\bf P}(x,B)\$ for fixed x is a probability measure in B. Let \$\Lambda \_i ,i = 1,2\$, be Banach spaces of completely additive functions of sets \$\lambda (B\_i )(B\_i \in \mathfrak{A}\_i )\$ with \$\lambda (\Omega \_i ) = 0\$ = 0 and with norm \[ \| \lambda \| = \mathop {\sup }\limits\_{B \in \mathfrak{A}\_i } |\lambda (B)|. \]By means of the equation \[ {\bf P}\lambda (B) = \int\_{\Omega \_i } {P(x,B)\lambda (dx)} ,\]any stochastic transition function defines the operator \${\bf P}\$ taking \$\Lambda \_1 \$ into \$\Lambda \_2 \$. Let \$N({\bf P})\$ be the norm of this operator \${\bf P}\$The number \$\alpha ({\bf P}) = 1 - N({\bf P})\$ is called the ergodic coefficient of this stochastic transition function. If we have a denumerable chain, then \${\bf P}\$ is a stochastic matrix \$(p\_{ij} )\$ and \[ \alpha ({\bf P}) = \mathop {\inf }\limits\_{k,l} \sum\limits\_{m = 1} {\min (p\_{lm} ,p\_{km} )} . \]A nonstationary chain with n moments of time is defined by a sequence of pairs \$(\Omega \_i^{(n)} \cdot \mathfrak{B}\_i^{(n)} ),i = i, \ldots ,n\$, transition functions \${\bf P}\_i^{(n)} (x,B)\$, \$(x \in \Omega \_i^{(n)} ,B \in \Omega \_{i + 1}^{(n)} ,i = 1, \ldots ,n - 1)\$ and the initial probability distribution \${\bf P}^{(n)} (B)\$\$P^{(n)} (B)(B \in \mathfrak{A}\_1 )\$. In a natural manner the probability measure is given in the space \$\Omega ^{(n)} = \Omega \_1^{(n)} \times \cdots \times \Omega \_n^{(n)} \$. Let \$X\_i^{(n)} \$ be a measurable function defined on \$\Omega \_i^{(n)} \$ and continued onto \$\Omega ^{(n)} \$, and let \[ S^{(n)} = X\_1^{(n)} + X\_2^{(n)} + \cdots X\_n^{(n)} . \] We shall consider the limit distribution for a sequence of random variables \[ \bar S^{(n)} = \frac{{S^{(n)} - {\bf E}S^{(n)} }}{{\sqrt {{\bf D}S^{(n)} } }}.\] By definition \[ \alpha ^{(n)} = \mathop {\min }\limits\_i \alpha ({\bf P}\_i^{(n)} ).\]Theorem 1: If 1) \${\bf D}X\_i^{(n)} > c > 0\$, 2) \$|X\_i^{(n)} | < C < \infty \$, 3) \$n^{1 / 3} \mathop {\min }\limits\_i \alpha ({\bf P}\_i^{(n)} ) \to \infty (n \to \infty )\$then\$\bar S^{(n)} \$is an asymptotically normal sequence of random variables.If we replace condition (2) by (\$2'\$) \$DX\_i^{(n)} < C < \infty \$,then the limit distribution for\$\bar S(n)\$will become an infinitely divisible distribution if it exists.This theorem is not valid if we replace condition (3) by \$n^{{1 / 3}} \mathop {\min }\limits\_i \alpha ({\bf P}\_i^{(n)} ) \to k < 0 (n \to \infty )\$Theorem 8: If conditions (1), (\$2'\$) and (3) are satisfied, \[F\_i^{(n)} (t) = {\bf P}\left\{ {X\_i^{(n)} - {\bf E}X\_i^{(n)} < t} \right\}\]and (4) \$\mathop {\lim }\limits\_{n \to \infty } \frac{1}{{n(\alpha ^{(n)} )^2 }}\mathop \sum \limits\_{i = 1}^n \int\_{|t| > rn^{{1 / 2}} (\alpha ^{(n)} )^{{3 / 2}} } {t^2 dF\_i^{(n)} (t)} = 0,\$then ,\$\bar S^{(n)} \$is an asymptotically normal sequence of random variables.If we replace condition (4) by a less stringent condition, Theorem 8 is not valid.A criterion for the ergodic properties of nonstationary Markov chains is also given. },

A factorization of the Metropolis filter and the concept of infinitesimal Monte Carlo moves are used to design a rejection-free Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm for particle systems with arbitrary pairwise interactions. The algorithm breaks detailed balance, but satisfies maximal global balance and performs better than the classic, local Metropolis algorithm in large systems. The new algorithm generates a continuum of samples of the stationary probability density. This allows us to compute the pressure and stress tensor as a byproduct of the simulation without any additional computations.},

abstract = {Objectives
Between 2015 and 2017, 41% of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cancer single-technology appraisal (STA) decisions relied upon immature survival data. This occurs when clinical trials that form the evidence base in support of new or existing technologies suffer from limited follow-up. During this period, NICE did not negatively recommend any cancer technologies that used immature data. This suggests a potential incentive to submit to NICE with immature data to avoid rejection. Using immature survival data in cost-effectiveness evaluations has resulted in significantly different conclusions compared with cost-effectiveness reestimations using matured data. We assessed the reliance on immature survival data in NICE decision making of cancer treatments, appraised after 2017.
Methods
A structured literature review of NICE cancer STAs published between 2018 and 2022 was conducted. The relationship between data maturity and NICE recommendations was assessed, and the extent to which past decisions were later reviewed was explored.
Results
56% (n = 57) of NICE’s cancer recommendations relied upon immature survival data. Fifty-four percent (n = 31) of these received a positive recommendation, 39% (n = 22) were placed into the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), and 7% (n = 4) received a negative recommendation. STAs with mature data received a similar proportion of negative recommendations. Only 1 non-CDF recommendation based on immature data was reappraised using updated survival data.
Conclusion
The majority of NICE cancer technology decisions are based on immature survival data and receive positive recommendations. Non-CDF decisions are unlikely to be reappraised. Consequently, many technologies could receive an inappropriate recommendation based on immature data and not be subsequently rectified.}

abstract = {Specification of the prior distribution for a Bayesian model is a central part of the Bayesian workflow for data analysis, but it is often difficult even for statistical experts. In principle, prior elicitation transforms domain knowledge of various kinds into well-defined prior distributions, and offers a solution to the prior specification problem. In practice, however, we are still fairly far from having usable prior elicitation tools that could significantly influence the way we build probabilistic models in academia and industry. We lack elicitation methods that integrate well into the Bayesian workflow and perform elicitation efficiently in terms of costs of time and effort. We even lack a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding different facets of the prior elicitation problem. Why are we not widely using prior elicitation? We analyse the state of the art by identifying a range of key aspects of prior knowledge elicitation, from properties of the modelling task and the nature of the priors to the form of interaction with the expert. The existing prior elicitation literature is reviewed and categorized in these terms. This allows recognizing under-studied directions in prior elicitation research, finally leading to a proposal of several new avenues to improve prior elicitation methodology.},

Oxidative stress has been found to play many important roles in cellular damage and loss of function in a number of tissues and organs and is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. Urinary biopyrrin levels have gained attention as an indicator of oxidative stress.  Aim and Objective:  To measure urinary biopyrrins excretion as a marker of oxidative stress in psoriasis.  Patients and Methods:  This case--control study was carried out on 85 subjects; 55 cases with chronic plaque psoriasis and 30 age, gender and body mass index-matched normal subjects as a control group. Urinary biopyrrin levels were measured using enzyme immunoassay.  Results:  There was a highly significant difference between cases and controls regarding urinary biopyrrins level (P < 0.001). There was significant positive correlation between biopyrrins level and both the age of cases (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and psoriasis area and severity index score (r = 0.99, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:  Urinary biopyrrins are increased in patients with psoriasis, and the level is correlated with disease severity. Further large-scale studies involving different ages and different clinical varieties of the disease are needed to expand and validate current findings. The clinical usefulness of antioxidants in psoriasis treatment needs to be evaluated in future research. Furthermore, the value of biopyrrins as biomarkers for monitoring response to therapy needs to be evaluated.},

It is a generalization of the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm allowing the trajectory length to be shrunk to the step-size without losing on the speed of configuration decorrelation. Without the Monte Carlo step, this limit of the generalized algorithm reduces to the second-order Langevin equation. The latter is shown in a gaussian model and in compact QED to be faster than the Hybrid algorithm. The performance of the two algorithms with the Monte Carlo step, HMC and L2MC, turned out to be comparable in compact QED. It is pointed out that L2MC is safer from rounding errors.}

  abstract = 	 {Despite their groundbreaking performance for many generative modeling tasks, diffusion models have fallen short on discrete data domains such as natural language. Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel loss that naturally extends score matching to discrete spaces, integrates seamlessly to build discrete diffusion models, and significantly boosts performance. Experimentally, we test our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) on standard language modeling tasks. For comparable model sizes, SEDD beats existing language diffusion paradigms (reducing perplexity by $25$-$75$%) and is competitive with autoregressive models, in particular outperforming GPT-2. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive mdoels, SEDD generates faithful text without requiring distribution annealing techniques like temperature scaling (around $6$-$8\times$ better generative perplexity than un-annealed GPT-2), can trade compute and quality (similar quality with $32\times$ fewer network evaluations), and enables controllable infilling (matching nucleus sampling quality while enabling other strategies besides left to right prompting).}

This pathology naturally occurs in Bayesian inference settings when there is a high signal-to-noise ratio in the observational data but the model is inherently over-parametrised or nonidentifiable. In this paper, we propose a strategy that transforms the original sampling problem into the task of exploring a distribution supported on a manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional space; in contrast to the original posterior this lifted distribution remains diffuse in the limit of vanishing observation noise. We employ a constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, which exploits the geometry of this lifted distribution, to perform efficient approximate inference. We demonstrate in numerical experiments that, contrarily to competing approaches, the sampling efficiency of our proposed methodology does not degenerate as the target distribution to be explored concentrates near low-dimensional submanifolds.

    abstract = { We propose sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for sampling the posterior distribution of state-space models under highly informative observation regimes, a situation in which standard SMC methods can perform poorly. A special case is simulating bridges between given initial and final values. The basic idea is to introduce a schedule of intermediate weighting and resampling times between observation times, which guide particles towards the final state. This can always be done for continuous-time models, and may be done for discrete-time models under sparse observation regimes; our main focus is on continuous-time diffusion processes. The methods are broadly applicable in that they support multivariate models with partial observation, do not require simulation of the backward transition (which is often unavailable), and, where possible, avoid pointwise evaluation of the forward transition. When simulating bridges, the last characteristic cannot be avoided entirely without concessions, and we suggest an \$\epsilon\$-ball approach (reminiscent of approximate Bayesian computation) as a workaround. Compared to the bootstrap particle filter, the new methods deliver substantially reduced mean squared error in normalizing constant estimates, even after accounting for execution time. The methods are demonstrated for state estimation with two toy examples, and for parameter estimation (within a particle marginal Metropolis--Hastings sampler) with three applied examples in econometrics, epidemiology, and marine biogeochemistry. }

  abstract = 	 {Typical generative diffusion models rely on a Gaussian diffusion process for training the backward transformations, which can then be used to generate samples from Gaussian noise. However, real world data often takes place in discrete-state spaces, including many scientific applications. Here, we develop a theoretical formulation for arbitrary discrete-state Markov processes in the forward diffusion process using exact (as opposed to variational) analysis. We relate the theory to the existing continuous-state Gaussian diffusion as well as other approaches to discrete diffusion, and identify the corresponding reverse-time stochastic process and score function in the continuous-time setting, and the reverse-time mapping in the discrete-time setting. As an example of this framework, we introduce “Blackout Diffusion”, which learns to produce samples from an empty image instead of from noise. Numerical experiments on the CIFAR-10, Binarized MNIST, and CelebA datasets confirm the feasibility of our approach. Generalizing from specific (Gaussian) forward processes to discrete-state processes without a variational approximation sheds light on how to interpret diffusion models, which we discuss.}

We develop novel connections between such Monte Carlo algorithms, the theory of Wasserstein gradient flow, and the operator splitting approach to solving PDEs. In particular, we show that a proximal version of the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm corresponds to a scheme that alternates between solving the gradient flows of two specific functionals on the space of probability measures. Using this perspective, we derive some new non-asymptotic results on the convergence properties of this algorithm.}

  abstract = 	 { Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become a go-to family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, in part because we have good procedures for automatically tuning its parameters. Much less attention has been paid to automatic tuning of generalized HMC (GHMC), in which the auxiliary momentum vector is partially updated frequently instead of being completely resampled infrequently. Since GHMC spreads progress over many iterations, it is not straightforward to tune GHMC based on quantities typically used to tune HMC such as average acceptance rate and squared jumped distance. In this work, we propose an ensemble-chain adaptation (ECA) algorithm for GHMC that automatically selects values for all of GHMC’s tunable parameters each iteration based on statistics collected from a population of many chains. This algorithm is designed to make good use of SIMD hardware accelerators such as GPUs, allowing most chains to be updated in parallel each iteration. Unlike typical adaptive-MCMC algorithms, our ECA algorithm does not perturb the chain’s stationary distribution, and therefore does not need to be “frozen” after warmup. Empirically, we find that the proposed algorithm quickly converges to its stationary distribution, producing accurate estimates of posterior expectations with relatively few gradient evaluations per chain. }

author = {B.T. Polyak},
abstract = {For the solution of the functional equation P (x) = 0 (1) (where P is an operator, usually linear, from B into B, and B is a Banach space) iteration methods are generally used. These consist of the construction of a series x0, …, xn, …, which converges to the solution (see, for example [1]). Continuous analogues of these methods are also known, in which a trajectory x(t), 0 ⩽ t ⩽ ∞ is constructed, which satisfies the ordinary differential equation in B and is such that x(t) approaches the solution of (1) as t → ∞ (see [2]). We shall call the method a k-step method if for the construction of each successive iteration xn+1 we use k previous iterations xn, …, xn−k+1. The same term will also be used for continuous methods if x(t) satisfies a differential equation of the k-th order or k-th degree. Iteration methods which are more widely used are one-step (e.g. methods of successive approximations). They are generally simple from the calculation point of view but often converge very slowly. This is confirmed both by the evaluation of the speed of convergence and by calculation in practice (for more details see below). Therefore the question of the rate of convergence is most important. Some multistep methods, which we shall consider further, which are only slightly more complicated than the corresponding one-step methods, make it possible to speed up the convergence substantially. Note that all the methods mentioned below are applicable also to the problem of minimizing the differentiable functional (x) in Hilbert space, so long as this problem reduces to the solution of the equation grad (x) = 0.}

@article{Dellacherie1980,
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present the principal results of a large part of stochastic calculus in a manner that should be comprehensible to readers having only the general notions of stochastic processes. Not all the theorems are proved in detail, but all the fundamental theorems are explained with clarity and precision, and with special attention to the motivations behind them. Given two real valued stochastic processes X and Y, the basic problem is to give a meaning to Z = ∫ Y dX in such a way that the integral sign is not misused. If X is a process whose paths are of bounded variation, then Z should coincide with the ordinary Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral taken path by path. If Y is a left continuous step function, then Z should coincide with the obvious choice: if Y is constant on ]t, u], then Zu-Zt is that constant times Xu-Xt. And finally, the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem should hold: if the processes Yn converge to Y and all the Yn are dominated by a process Y' for which ∝ Y' dX is well defined, then Zn = ∫ Yn dX should converge to Z = ∫ Y dX in some sense. Starting with these requirements, it is shown that, if ∫ Y dX is defined for all predictable Y, then X must be a semimartingale. Conversely, the integral is well defined for all predictable Y and all semimartingales X. With the integrals defined, a number of their important properties are discussed. In particular, the integral Z is a semimartingale, and a change of variable formula (Ito's formula) holds for ⨍(Z). Finally, stochastic integral equations are introduced, and a general theorem is given on the existence and uniqueness of solutions. A bibliography with commentaries supplements the text for the benefit of those who would like to go deeper into the subject.},

@article{Berthier+2024,
	abstract = {Gradient-based learning in multi-layer neural networks displays a number of striking features. In particular, the decrease rate of empirical risk is non-monotone even after averaging over large batches. Long plateaus in which one observes barely any progress alternate with intervals of rapid decrease. These successive phases of learning often take place on very different time scales. Finally, models learnt in an early phase are typically `simpler'or `easier to learn'although in a way that is difficult to formalize. Although theoretical explanations of these phenomena have been put forward, each of them captures at best certain specific regimes. In this paper, we study the gradient flow dynamics of a wide two-layer neural network in high-dimension, when data are distributed according to a single-index model (i.e., the target function depends on a one-dimensional projection of the covariates). Based on a mixture of new rigorous results, non-rigorous mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we propose a scenario for the learning dynamics in this setting. In particular, the proposed evolution exhibits separation of timescales and intermittency. These behaviors arise naturally because the population gradient flow can be recast as a singularly perturbed dynamical system.},

  abstract = 	 {Variational inference (VI) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are approximate posterior inference algorithms that are often said to have complementary strengths, with VI being fast but biased and MCMC being slower but asymptotically unbiased. In this paper, we analyze gradient-based MCMC and VI procedures and find theoretical and empirical evidence that these procedures are not as different as one might think. In particular, a close examination of the Fokker-Planck equation that governs the Langevin dynamics (LD) MCMC procedure reveals that LD implicitly follows a gradient flow that corresponds to a variational inference procedure based on optimizing a nonparametric normalizing flow. This result suggests that the transient bias of LD (due to the Markov chain not having burned in) may track that of VI (due to the optimizer not having converged), up to differences due to VI’s asymptotic bias and parameterization. Empirically, we find that the transient biases of these algorithms (and their momentum-accelerated counterparts) do evolve similarly. This suggests that practitioners with a limited time budget may get more accurate results by running an MCMC procedure (even if it’s far from burned in) than a VI procedure, as long as the variance of the MCMC estimator can be dealt with (e.g., by running many parallel chains).}

abstract = {One main limitation of the existing optimal scaling results for Metropolis–Hastings algorithms is that the assumptions on the target distribution are unrealistic. In this paper, we consider optimal scaling of random-walk Metropolis algorithms on general target distributions in high dimensions arising from practical MCMC models from Bayesian statistics. For optimal scaling by maximizing expected squared jumping distance (ESJD), we show the asymptotically optimal acceptance rate 0.234 can be obtained under general realistic sufficient conditions on the target distribution. The new sufficient conditions are easy to be verified and may hold for some general classes of MCMC models arising from Bayesian statistics applications, which substantially generalize the product i.i.d. condition required in most existing literature of optimal scaling. Furthermore, we show one-dimensional diffusion limits can be obtained under slightly stronger conditions, which still allow dependent coordinates of the target distribution. We also connect the new diffusion limit results to complexity bounds of Metropolis algorithms in high dimensions.}

abstract = {Summary. The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis–Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

abstract="This course explains how the usual mean field evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) in Statistical Physics---such as the Vlasov-Poisson system, the vorticity formulation of the two-dimensional Euler equation for incompressible fluids, or the time-dependent Hartree equation in quantum mechanics---can be rigorously derived from the fundamental microscopic equations that govern the evolution of large, interacting particle systems. The emphasis is put on the mathematical methods used in these derivations, such as Dobrushin's stability estimate in the Monge-Kantorovich distance for the empirical measures built on the solution of the N-particle motion equations in classical mechanics, or the theory of BBGKY hierarchies in the case of classical as well as quantum problems. We explain in detail how these different approaches are related; in particular we insist on the notion of chaotic sequences and on the propagation of chaos in the BBGKY hierarchy as the number of particles tends to infinity.",

Moreover, t→u(t,u0) is a semigroup of contractions in L1(Rd), which leaves invariant the set of probability density functions in Rd. If divD≥0, β′(r)≥a|r|α−1, and |β(r)|≤Crα, α≥1, d≥3, then |u(t)|L∞≤Ct−dd+(α−1)d|u0|22+(m−1)d, t>0, and if D∈L2(Rd;Rd) the existence extends to initial data u0 in the space Mb of bounded measures in Rd. As a consequence for arbitrary initial laws, we obtain weak solutions to a class of McKean-Vlasov SDEs with coefficients which have singular dependence on the time marginal laws.}
