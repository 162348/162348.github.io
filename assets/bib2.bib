	abstract = {A sequence of random variables is called exchangeable if the joint distribution of the sequence is unchanged by any permutation of the indices. De Finetti's theorem characterizes all {0,1}-valued exchangeable sequences as a `mixture' of sequences of independent random variables. We present a new, elementary proof of de Finetti's Theorem. The purpose of this paper is to make this theorem accessible to a broader community through an essentially self-contained proof.},

	abstract = {Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. An increase in the severity of albuminuria and a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, by which the DKD stages are categorized, are associated with higher risks of not only end-stage renal disease but also all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Thus, an optimal management strategy and adequate assessment of therapeutic success are of great clinical and societal relevance to improve the prognosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKD. At present, comprehensive risk management for glycemia, blood pressure, lipid profile, and lifestyle habits is emphasized with respect to cardio-renal protection, rather than one single risk management approach. However, the pharmacological therapy aiming at strict control of these risk factors may be associated with an increased risk of adverse effects, particularly in older adults with diabetes. Accordingly, in the clinical practice of diabetes care, we need to individualize the treatment goals for each risk factor according to the health and social status of each patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and DKD.},

  abstract = 	 {Copulas allow to learn marginal distributions separately from the multivariate dependence structure (copula) that links them together into a density function.  Vine factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference, it is common to assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent from its conditioning variables.  In this paper, we relax this assumption by discovering the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning variables.  We learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for scalable, approximate inference. Experiments on real-world datasets show that, when modeling all conditional dependencies, we obtain better estimates of the underlying copula of the data.}
