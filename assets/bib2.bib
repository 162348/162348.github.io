	abstract = {A sequence of random variables is called exchangeable if the joint distribution of the sequence is unchanged by any permutation of the indices. De Finetti's theorem characterizes all {0,1}-valued exchangeable sequences as a `mixture' of sequences of independent random variables. We present a new, elementary proof of de Finetti's Theorem. The purpose of this paper is to make this theorem accessible to a broader community through an essentially self-contained proof.},
