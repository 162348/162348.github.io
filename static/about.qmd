## Hello!

Hirofumi is a Ph.D. student supervised by [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home) at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) (ISM), Tokyo, Japan.

My research aims to deepen our understanding of learning algorithms, especially Monte Carlo and optimization methods, through the lens of their (scaling / continuous-time) limit dynamics.

From these perspectives, algorithms reveal their intrinsic properties, and my work seeks to provide a unified understanding of various algorithms under a common mathematical framework, i.e., flows on the space of probability measures.

<!-- Before pursuing my Ph.D., I was trained in mathematics at the University of Tokyo, with an emphasis on Stochastic Processes and Functional Analysis. -->

<!-- ## Biography {.appendix} -->
<!-- 
::: {.column-page-inset}

::: {.callout-tip title="$\quad$ Biography" icon="false" collapse="true"}

I was born in Yokohama, Japan in May 1999. While holding Japanese citizenship, I am a native speaker of Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been fascinated by Mathematics. To me, it is an organized wisdom to exploit connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.

As Poincaré noted "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things," transforming mere analogy into profound insights readily applicable.

Currently, I work on Computational Statistics, seeing it from the perspective of stochastic processes as a system of evolving probability measures.

Before this role, I was a data scientist at IMIS Co., Ltd., providing data analysis and consulting for Japanese manufacturing companies.

As a Bayesian computation practitioner, I also contribute to the R package [YUIMA](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project designed for simulating and inferring multidimensional stochastic differential equations.
