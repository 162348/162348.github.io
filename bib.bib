Here we describe how ML can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by ML, in collaboration with other fields. Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the ML community to join the global effort against climate change.},

When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results without the need for any dataset specific fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.},

title = {Batch normalization: accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift},
year = {2015},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {This work explores conditional image generation with a new image density model based on the PixelCNN architecture. The model can be conditioned on any vector, including descriptive labels or tags, or latent embeddings created by other networks. When conditioned on class labels from the ImageNet database, the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional PixelCNN can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally, the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood of PixelCNN to match the state-of-the-art performance of PixelRNN on ImageNet, with greatly reduced computational cost.},

abstract = {Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pretraining objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

  abstract = 	 {We present Muse, a text-to-image Transformermodel that achieves state-of-the-art image genera-tion performance while being significantly moreefficient than diffusion or autoregressive models.Muse is trained on a masked modeling task indiscrete token space: given the text embeddingextracted from a pre-trained large language model(LLM), Muse learns to predict randomly maskedimage tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusionmodels, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse issignificantly more efficient due to the use of dis-crete tokens and requires fewer sampling itera-tions; compared to autoregressive models such asParti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of par-allel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM en-ables fine-grained language understanding, whichtranslates to high-fidelity image generation andthe understanding of visual concepts such as ob-jects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinalityetc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a newSOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. TheMuse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with aCLIP score of 0.32. Muse also directly enables anumber of image editing applications without theneed to fine-tune or invert the model: inpainting,outpainting, and mask-free editing.
