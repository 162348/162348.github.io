**Hirofumi Shiba** is a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) in Japan, specializing in **Bayesian Computation**. This field focuses on developing computational methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), for Bayesian inference and learning.

Additionally, he is a cooperative researcher at [RCAST, the University of Tokyo](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), where he is involved in a project aimed at researching trustworthy AI systems by incorporating **uncertainty quantification**.

## Biography

He was born in Yokohama Japan in May 1999. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the Univ. of Tokyo in 2023, where he was mentored by Prof. [Nakahiro Yoshida](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~nakahiro/hp-naka.htm).

Expanding his study on statistical inference for stochastic processes, he is now further specializing in MCMCs and interacting particle methods under the supervision of Prof. [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

He speaks, reads, and writes in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and English.

He also contributes to the [YUIMA package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project concerned with the simulation and inference of multidimensional stochastic differential equations.

This blog was branched off from the [team's homepage](https://anomath.com) to cover more specialized topics in English and Japanese. The team name "Ano2math5" is pronounced in the same way as the word "anonymous" when read in Japanese.

## Interest

I am deeply fascinated by 

* **Probabilistic Modelling**, a domain dedicated to developing machine learning models that can simultaneously capture both structure and uncertainty in data in a principled manner, as well as
* **Bayesian Computation**, which focuses on advancing computational techniques for Bayesian inference and learning.

My current research involves devising more efficient and scalable **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC) and **Sequential Monte Carlo** (SMC) algorithms for probabilistic machine learning, Bayesian inference, and scientific data analysis.

At my core, I am an **applied mathematician**, and these interests stem from a desire to promote mutual understanding among humans, nature, and computers through mathematics, including stochastic processes, functional analysis, and mathematical logic.

I am deeply fascinated by Bayesian Computation, a domain dedicated to advancing computational techniques for Bayesian inference and learning. My current research is on exploring the convergence properties of particle methods, especially the Sequential Monte Carlo methods.

I firmly believe that Bayesian methods represent an exceptionally effective approach for sharing the world models of various entities in a format understandable by both humans and machines. This conviction has broadened my interest to include applied Bayesian modelling.

It is my aspiration to demonstrate that mathematics is a universal form comprehensible to humans, animals, and computers equally. My blog aims to become a hub where we explore more effective ways of communication among these diverse entities.
