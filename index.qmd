## Hello! I'm Hiro.

Hirofumi Shiba is a Ph.D. student jointly supervised by [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home) and [Keisuke Yano](https://sites.google.com/site/kyanostat/) at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) (ISM), Tokyo, Japan.

<!-- I am an applied mathematician by training, now working on Computational Statistics. -->

My research focuses around Monte Carlo algorithms and numerical computation. By making them more efficient, scalable, and automated, I aim to broaden the applications of statistics and machine learning.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I studied Mathematics at the University of Tokyo.

## Research

My research interests revolve around developing and analyzing sampling algorithms, by leveraging insights from their continuous-time limit dynamics. From this perspective, algorithms reveal their intrinsic properties, and my work aims to unify the understanding of various algorithms under a common mathematical framework of Optimal Transport.

Additionally, I engage in Bayesian data analysis in collaboration with healthcare and engineering companies.

<!-- ## Biography {.appendix} -->
<!-- 
::: {.column-page-inset}

::: {.callout-tip title="$\quad$ Biography" icon="false" collapse="true"}

I was born in Yokohama, Japan in May 1999. While holding Japanese citizenship, I am a native speaker of Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been fascinated by Mathematics. To me, it is an organized wisdom to exploit connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.

As Poincaré noted "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things," transforming mere analogy into profound insights readily applicable.

Currently, I work on Computational Statistics, seeing it from the perspective of stochastic processes as a system of evolving probability measures.

Before this role, I was a data scientist at IMIS Co., Ltd., providing data analysis and consulting for Japanese manufacturing companies.

As a Bayesian computation practitioner, I also contribute to the R package [YUIMA](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project designed for simulating and inferring multidimensional stochastic differential equations.
