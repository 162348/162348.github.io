## Hello!
My name is **Hirofumi Shiba**. Feel free to call me Hiro.

I am an applied mathematician by training, now working on Computational Statistics.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) (ISM) in Tokyo, Japan, advised by Prof. [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

My research focuses on developing more efficient, scalable and automated sampling algorithms, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo, to broaden the applications of statistics and machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research interests center around developing and analysing stochastic algorithms, by leveraging insights from their continuous-time limit dynamics. From this perspective, algorithms reveal their intrinsic properties, and my work aims to unify the understanding of various algorithms under a common framework.

## Biography {.appendix}

I was born in Yokohama, Japan in May 1999. While holding Japanese citizenship, I am a native speaker of Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.

From the very beginning of my academic journey, I have been fascinated by Mathematics. To me, it is an organized wisdom to exploit connections between seemingly unrelated concepts.

As Poincaré noted "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things," transforming mere analogy into profound insights readily applicable.

Currently, I work on Computational Statistics, seeing it from the perspective of stochastic processes as a system of evolving probability measures.

Before this role, I was a data scientist at IMIS Co., Ltd., providing data analysis and consulting for Japanese manufacturing companies.

As a Bayesian computation practitioner, I also contribute to the R package [YUIMA](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project designed for simulating and inferring multidimensional stochastic differential equations.
