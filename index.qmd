Hello, my name is **Hirofumi Shiba**. Feel free to call me Hiro. I am an Applied Mathematics researcher, specializing in Bayesian Computation.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [**Institute of Statistical Mathematics**](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) (ISM) in Japan, working with Prof. [**Kengo Kamatani**](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

My primary research focus is on developing more efficient, scalable and automatic sampling algorithms, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), by leveraging the insights from their continuous-time limits.

## Education

* **Ph.D. in Statistical Science**
    
    [Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI](https://www.soken.ac.jp/en/), Tokyo, Japan
    
    Apr. 2023 - Mar. 2028 (expected)

* **B.A. in Mathematics**
    
    [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), Japan
    
    Apr. 2019 - Mar. 2023

## Experience

* 2023.7- Research Assistant at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html)

* 2023.4- [Cooperative Researcher](https://esrp.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/experts/hirofumi-shiba/?lang=en) at the [RCAST, the University of Tokyo](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html)

## Biography {.appendix}

He was born in Yokohama Japan in May 1999. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the Univ. of Tokyo in 2023, where he was mentored by Prof. [Nakahiro Yoshida](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~nakahiro/hp-naka.htm).

Expanding his study on statistical inference for stochastic processes, he is now further specializing in sampling methods and interacting particle methods under the supervision of Prof. [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

He speaks, reads, and writes in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and English.

He also contributes to the [YUIMA package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source projectaiming to simulate and infer multidimensional stochastic differential equations.

This blog was branched off from the [team's homepage](https://anomath.com) to cover more specialized topics in English and Japanese. The team name "Ano2math5" is pronounced in the same way as the word "anonymous" when read in Japanese.

Additionally, he is a cooperative researcher at [RCAST, the University of Tokyo](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), where he is engaged in a project that aims to build trustworthy AI systems and a robust semiconductor ecosystem from a policy perspective, incorporating uncertainty quantification as a key component.

## Interest {.appendix}

I am deeply fascinated by 

* **Probabilistic Modelling**, a domain dedicated to developing machine learning models that can simultaneously capture both structure and uncertainty in data in a principled manner, as well as
* **Bayesian Computation**, which focuses on developing and improving computational methods for Bayesian inference and learning.

My current interest lies in understanding and acquiring unified perspectives on sampling and optimization as a flow on the space of probability measures, $\mathcal{P}(X)$.

At my core, I am an **applied mathematician**, driven by a desire to foster mutual understanding among humans, nature, and computers, utilizing mathematics as a common language. As we are still in the process of learning, it is remarkable that [(probability) measures and (Markov) kernels have proven to be **unreasonably effective** in describing the world models of all three aforementioned entities]{.underline}.

> The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, **the sense of being more than Man**, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry. -- Bertrand Russell (1959) _My Philosophical Development_

I am deeply fascinated by Bayesian Computation, a domain dedicated to advancing computational techniques for Bayesian inference and learning. My current research is on exploring the convergence properties of particle methods, especially the Sequential Monte Carlo methods.

I firmly believe that Bayesian methods represent an exceptionally effective approach for sharing the world models of various entities in a format understandable by both humans and machines. This conviction has broadened my interest to include applied Bayesian modelling.

It is my aspiration to demonstrate that mathematics is a universal form comprehensible to humans, animals, and computers equally. My blog aims to become a hub where we explore more effective ways of communication among these diverse entities.
