## Biography

**Hirofumi Shiba** is a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) in Japan, specializing in Bayesian Computation, a field focused on developing computational methods for Bayesian inference and learning.

He was born in Yokohama in May 1999. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the Univ. of Tokyo in 2023, where he was mentored by Prof. [Nakahiro Yoshida](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~nakahiro/hp-naka.htm).

Expanding his study on statistical inference for stochastic processes, he is now further specializing in nonlinear filtering and interacting particle methods under the supervision of Prof. [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

He speaks, reads, and writes in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and English.

He also contributes to the [YUIMA package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project concerned with the simulation and inference of multidimensional stochastic differential equations.

This blog was branched off from the [team's homepage](https://anomath.com) to cover more specialized topics in English and Japanese. The team name "Ano2math5" is pronounced in the same way as the word "anonymous" when read in Japanese.

## Education

## Interest

I am deeply fascinated by Bayesian Computation, a domain dedicated to advancing computational techniques for Bayesian inference and learning. My current research is on exploring the convergence properties of particle methods, especially the Sequential Monte Carlo methods.

I firmly believe that Bayesian methods represent an exceptionally effective approach for sharing the world models of various entities in a format understandable by both humans and machines. This conviction has broadened my interest to include applied Bayesian modelling.

It is my aspiration to demonstrate that mathematics is a universal form comprehensible to humans, animals, and computers equally. My blog aims to become a hub where we explore more effective ways of communication among these diverse entities.
