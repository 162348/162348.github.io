## Hello!
My name is **Hirofumi Shiba**. Feel free to call me Hiro.

I am an Applied Mathematics researcher, specializing in Bayesian Computation.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) (ISM) in Tokyo, Japan, working with Prof. [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

My research focuses on developing more efficient, scalable and automated sampling algorithms, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo, to broaden the applications of statistics and machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research interests center around developing and analysing stochastic algorithms, by leveraging insights from their continuous-time limit dynamics. From this perspective, algorithms reveal their intrinsic properties, and my work aims to unify the understanding of various algorithms under a common framework.

## Biography {.appendix}

He was born in Yokohama, Japan in May 1999. He holds Japanese citizenship, but is a native speaker of Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. He is fluent in English as well.

Prior to this role, he worked as a data scientist at IMIS Co., Ltd., where he provided data analysis and consulting for Japanese manufacturing companies.

As a Bayesian computation practitioner, he also contributes to the R package [YUIMA](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project designed for simulating and inferring multidimensional stochastic differential equations.

<!-- Additionally, he is a cooperative researcher at [RCAST, the University of Tokyo](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html), where he is engaged in a project that aims to build trustworthy AI systems and a robust semiconductor ecosystem from a policy perspective, incorporating uncertainty quantification as a key component. -->
