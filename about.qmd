## Biography

**Hirofumi Shiba**, specializing in Bayesian Computation -- a field focused on developing computational methods for Bayesian inference and learning -- is a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) in Japan.

He was born in Yokohama in May 1999. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the University of Tokyo in 2023, where he was mentored by Professor [Nakahiro Yoshida](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~nakahiro/hp-naka.htm).

Continuing his focus on statistical inference for stochastic processes, he is now
further specializing in nonlinear filtering and particle methods under the supervision of Professor [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

He is fluent in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and English.

He also contributes to the [YUIMA package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project focused on the simulation and inference of multidimensional stochastic differential equations.

This blog was branched off from the [team's homepage](https://anomath.com) to cover more specialized topics in English and Japanese. The team name "Ano2math5" is pronounced in the same way as the word "anonymous" when read in Japanese.
