## Biography

**Hirofumi Shiba** is a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Statistical Mathematics](https://www.ism.ac.jp/index_e.html) in Japan, specializing in Bayesian Computation, a field focused on developing computational methods for Bayesian inference and learning.

He was born in Yokohama in May 1999. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics from the University of Tokyo in 2023, where he was mentored by Professor [Nakahiro Yoshida](https://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~nakahiro/hp-naka.htm).

Expanding his study on statistical inference for stochastic processes, he is now further specializing in nonlinear filtering and particle methods under the supervision of Professor [Kengo Kamatani](https://sites.google.com/view/kengokamatani/home).

He is fluent in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and English.

He also contributes to the [YUIMA package](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/yuima/), an open-source project concerned with the simulation and inference of multidimensional stochastic differential equations.

This blog was branched off from the [team's homepage](https://anomath.com) to cover more specialized topics in English and Japanese. The team name "Ano2math5" is pronounced in the same way as the word "anonymous" when read in Japanese.

## Education

## Interest

I am deeply fascinated by Bayesian Computation, a domain dedicated to advancing computational techniques for Bayesian inference and learning. My current focus is on exploring the convergence properties of particle methods, especially the Sequential Monte Carlo methods.

I am fully convinced that Bayesian methods are one of the most effective mathematical approaches for translating the world models of all beings into a format understandable by both humans and computers. This conviction has broadened my interest to include Bayesian modelling and its applications.

It is my hope to demonstrate that mathematics is *the* form which can be understood by humans, animals, and computers equally. My blog aims to become a place where we can find better ways to communicate with each other.
