## Directory Structure of `PDMPFlux.jl/src`

### `Composites.jl`

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}


composites / constructs such as `BoundBox`, `PDMPState`, `PDMPHistory` are defined.
    
* `BoundBox` is basically a grid, together with the values on it, to perform thinning.

* `PDMPState` is used to keep the position of the sampler. In addition to the $(x,v,t)$ tuple, there are 
    * boolean flags to indicate whether Poisson thinning proposal is accepted or not.
