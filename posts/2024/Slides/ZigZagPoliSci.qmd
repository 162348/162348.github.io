  Zig-Zag sampler, known as an instance of 'Continuous-time MCMC', is a cutting-edge sampling method that exhibits scalability and state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional models including logistic models etc. This talk includes a brief introduction to the Zig-Zag sampler and the two important properties, irreversibility of its dynamics and thinning of Poisson point processes, followed by a few numerical experiments on logistic models with large and unbalanced data.

### Keywords: PDMP (1/2)

[PDMP]{.underline} (Piecewise Deterministic^[Mostly [deterministic]{.color-unite} with the exception of random jumps happens at random times] Markov Process^[[Continuous-time]{.color-unite}, instead of discrete-time processes]) [@Davis1984]

1. Mostly [deterministic]{.color-unite} with the exception of random jumps happens at random times
2. [Continuous-time]{.color-unite}, instead of discrete-time processes

1. First applications: control theory, operations research, etc. [@Davis1993]
2. Second applications: Monte Carlo simulation in material sciences [@Peters-deWith2012]
3. Third applications: Bayesian statistics [@Bouchard-Cote+2018-BPS]

### Keywords: PDMP (2/2)

* We will concentrate on Zig-Zag sampler [@Bierkens+2019]
* Other PDMPs: Bouncy sampler [@Bouchard-Cote+2018-BPS] , Boomerang sampler [@Bierkens+2020]

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false" title="What We've Learned"}

The new algorithm 'Zig-Zag Sampler' is based on comtinuous-time process called [PDMP]{.color-unite}.
