  Zig-Zag sampler, known as an instance of 'Continuous-time MCMC', is a cutting-edge sampling method that exhibits scalability and state-of-the-art performance on high-dimensional models including logistic model etc. This talk includes a brief introduction to the Zig-Zag sampler and the two important properties, irreversibility of its dynamics and thinning of Poisson point processes, followed by a few numerical experiments on logistic models with large and unbalanced data.
