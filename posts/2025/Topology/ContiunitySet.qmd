  The set of all continuity points of a function is a $G_\delta$ set. Conversely, every $G_\delta$ set is the set of all continuity points of some function. We construct an example of a function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ that is continuous on $(-\infty,0]$ but discontinuous on $(0,\infty)$.

For the sake of simplicity, we focus on the case of $f:\R\to\R$.

This article is concerned with the *continuity set* of $f$, defined as
$$
\Cont(f):=\Brace{x\in\R\mid f\text{ is continuous at }x}.
$$

Most continuous functions are treated on open sets. We might be easily tricked to think that $\Cont(f)$ should be open.

Is this conjecture true?^[It is not true.] As a starting point, proving that $\Cont(f)$ is a countable intersection of open sets is not difficult.

## $\Cont(f)$ is $G_\delta$

We denote an open ball of radius $\delta$ centered at $x$ by $U_\delta(x)$.

$\Cont(f)$ is a $G_\delta$ set, meaning that it is a countable intersection of open sets. Specifically,
$$
\Cont(f)=\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\Brace{x\in\R\,\middle|\,\exists_{\delta>0}\;\forall_{y,z\in U_\delta(x)}\;\abs{f(y)-f(z)}<\frac{1}{n}}.
$$

It is straightforward to check that each $\Brace{x\in\R\,\middle|\,\exists_{\delta>0}\;\forall_{y,z\in U_\delta(x)}\;\abs{f(y)-f(z)}<\frac{1}{n}}$ is open.

The easy part is the $\supset$ direction, since for every $\ep>0$, there exists a $N>0$ satisfying $\frac{1}{N}<\ep$.

$\subset$ direction is also straightforward, following from the definition of continuity and triangle inequality.

## $G_\delta$ sets are continuity sets

A fun fact is that every $G_\delta$ set is the continuity set $\Cont(f)$ of some function $f$, proved in, for example, a almost one-page article [@Kim1999].

::: {.callout-tip title="[Theorem p.258 @Kim1999]" icon="false"}

Let $X$ be a nonempty metric space without isolated points. Then every $G_\delta$ subset $G\subset X$ is the continuity set of some function $f:X\to\R$.

This construction can be understood as a generalization of the example given later in @sec-example.

Given that $G$ is a $G_\delta$ set, the complement $G^\comp$ is a countable union of closed sets:
$$
G^\comp=\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty F_n,\qquad F_n\csub X.
$$

Using $\{F_n\}$, we construct a function $g:X\to\R$ as follows:
$$
g(x):=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{2^n}1_{F_n}(x).
$$
Observe that $g=0\;\on G$. Building upon this, we define $f:X\to\R$ by
$$
f(x):=g(x)\paren{1_A(x)-\frac{1}{2}}
$$
where $A\subset X$ be a set that both $A$ and $A^\comp$ are dense in $X$.

This set $A$ corresponds $\bQ$ in the example given later in @sec-example.

## Example of $f:\R\to\R$ with closed $\Cont(f)$ {#sec-example}

In perfectly regular spaces, every closed set is a $G_\delta$ set [@Tong1952].

So there should be an example on $\R$ that $\Cont(f)$ is closed.

::: {.callout-caution title="Example^[My colleague Nakajima-san taught me this example.]" icon="false"}

The function $f$ defined as follows has $\Cont(f)=\ocinterval{-\infty,0}$:
$$
f(x):=\begin{cases}
0,&x\le0,\\
\frac{1}{n},&x\in(0,\infty)\cap\bQ,\\
-\frac{1}{n},&x\in(0,\infty)\setminus\bQ.
\end{cases}
$$
