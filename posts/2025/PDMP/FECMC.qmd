FECMC is a generalization of BPS in that it reduces to BPS when the orthogonal components are fully refreshed.

However, an interesting phenomenon is that the scaling limit seems to be entirely different from the BPS case, when orthogonal switches are employed as recommended in [@Michel+2020].

The frequency of orthogonal switches seems to be crucial. As an edge case, without refreshing the orthogonal components, the scaling limit seems to lose ergodicity:

## Animations

Below I'll list the animations of the trajectories of FECMC (1) with its orthogonal components fully refreshed, (2) switched, and (3) no orthogonal refresh.
