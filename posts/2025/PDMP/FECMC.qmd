FECMC is a generalization of BPS in that it reduces to BPS (in the limit) when the orthogonal components are fully refreshed.^[FECMC with full orthogonal refresh is $d\to\infty$ asymptotically equivalent to BPS, allegedly.]

However, an interesting phenomenon is that the scaling limit seems to be entirely different from the BPS case, when orthogonal switches are employed as recommended in [@Michel+2020].

The frequency of orthogonal switches seems to be crucial. As an edge case, without refreshing the orthogonal components, the scaling limit seems to lose ergodicity:

## Animations

Below we'll list the animations of the trajectories of FECMC (1) with its orthogonal components fully refreshed, (2) switched, and (3) no orthogonal refresh.

## The Dynamics of FECMC with no refresh

The deterministic dynamics seems to be determined by the initial value.

Here we add two more examples with different initial values:
