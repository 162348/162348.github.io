Hey! We have just branched this blog from [Wordpress](https://anomath.com) to github.
The new version is based on [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), which will make it much easier to write mathematical sentences, e.g. $\pi(\theta|x) \propto \pi(\theta)
L(x|\theta)$, and codes, e.g. 

```python
import numpy as np

def fact(n):
    return np.prod(range(1, n + 1))
```

また日本語での記述も当然できます！
